**Lesson 13: Building Web Applications with Ruby on Rails**

**1. Introduction to Ruby on Rails**
Ruby on Rails (often called Rails) is a popular web application framework written in Ruby. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and emphasizes convention over configuration.

**2. Creating a Rails Application**
You can create a new Rails application using the `rails new` command:

```bash
rails new myapp
```

**3. MVC Architecture**
Rails separates the application into three main components:

- Model: Represents the data and business logic.
- View: Displays information to users.
- Controller: Handles user requests and manages the flow of data between the model and view.

**4. Routing**
Routes define how URLs map to controller actions. You can define routes in the `config/routes.rb` file.

**5. Controllers and Actions**
Controllers contain methods (actions) that respond to user requests. An action typically renders a view or redirects to another action.

**6. Views and Templates**
Views are templates that define the presentation logic of your application. Rails uses embedded Ruby (ERB) syntax for mixing Ruby code with HTML.

**7. Database and Models**
Rails provides an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) through ActiveRecord. You can define models to interact with the database.

**8. Database Migrations**
Migrations allow you to manage changes to your database schema over time. You can create and run migrations using the `rails generate` and `rails db:migrate` commands.

**9. Form Handling**
Rails provides helpers for generating and handling forms in views. Form data is typically sent to controllers for processing.

**10. Asset Pipeline**
The asset pipeline manages assets like stylesheets and JavaScript files. It helps optimize and manage asset delivery.

**11. RESTful Routing**
Rails promotes RESTful routing, which follows a set of conventions for creating routes and actions based on the CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

**12. Helpers and Partials**
Rails provides view helpers for generating HTML and other content. Partials allow you to reuse view components across different views.

**13. Authentication and Authorization**
Rails offers gems like Devise and CanCanCan for handling user authentication and authorization.

**14. Testing in Rails**
Rails encourages test-driven development. You can write tests using frameworks like Minitest or RSpec.

**15. Deployment**
You can deploy Rails applications to various platforms, including cloud services like Heroku or traditional web servers like Apache or Nginx.

**16. Code Sample: Building a Simple Rails App**
Here's a simple example of building a Rails app:

```bash
# Create a new Rails app
rails new blog

# Generate a model and migration
rails generate model Post title:string content:text

# Run migrations
rails db:migrate

# Generate a controller and views
rails generate controller Posts

# Define routes in config/routes.rb
resources :posts

# Build the controller and views
```

**Next Steps**
Ruby on Rails is a powerful framework for building web applications. As you continue learning, you can explore more advanced topics like handling authentication and authorization, working with APIs, optimizing performance, and deploying your applications to production.
